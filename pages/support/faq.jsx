    question: "What do you mean by all proceeds go to source?",
    answer:
      "Unless you decide to cover processing fees, Kinship pays for it out of pocket. Any other costs incurred in sending your money to the donee, such as flights and hotels for volunteers, wire transfer fees, etc, Kinship pays for out of pocket.",

    answer:
      "You will receive proof of your donation both by email and on your dashboard (in the proof tab). If you donate a custom amount, proof may take longer as we pool funds to provide one full donation - for example, if you donate $500 towards a house we would wait for the remaining amount needed to build one full house before sending the funds.",
