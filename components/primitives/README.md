# Primitives

These are modular, reusable UI components. These should have a primary function with settings such that they can be used across the app. When designing primitives, its better to think of the major use cases and allow those, while restricting edge cases (allowing the component to be used in a versatile way but without introducing tons of complexity.)

Developers should be able to use these primitives without needing to read an API reference - the parameters should be self explanatory.
